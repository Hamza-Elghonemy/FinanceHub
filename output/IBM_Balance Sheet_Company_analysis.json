        "company_insights": "IBM's current ratio of 0.964 indicates that the company has slightly less current assets than current liabilities, which may pose liquidity risks. The debt-to-equity ratio of 2.224 suggests a high level of leverage, indicating that the company relies heavily on debt financing. The equity growth of 0.6% from the previous quarter shows a slight improvement in shareholder equity, but the overall financial health may be a concern due to high debt levels.",
        "comparative_insights": "Compared to the average current ratio of 1.12, IBM's liquidity position is weaker, indicating potential challenges in meeting short-term obligations. The debt-to-equity ratio of 2.224 is significantly higher than the average of 0.75, highlighting a more aggressive capital structure. The equity growth percentage of 0.6% is below the average of 5%, suggesting that IBM is not growing its equity base as effectively as its peers."
